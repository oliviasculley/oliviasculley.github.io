Slipstream's stack of Elixir, Phoenix, and Vanilla JS/Tailwind CSS has been an absolute joy to learn and work with, and being able to implement the actor model in Slipstream's architecture has been especially rewarding.\n\nIn the 3+ years of working on Slipstream, I've implemented many core features like versioning, tenancy, synthesized data exports, user notifications, custom integrations, and building out the core UI component library and storybook. We're currently using CI with Github Actions, error reporting with Sentry, documentation with Mermaid, payments with Stripe and email integration with Customer.io. However, it's truly been rewarding to work with and mentor team members on a larger and longer term project, navigating all the challenges like onboarding, improving our development process as a team, and tech debt prioritization.\n\nBy the way, we're currently looking for 3 more businesses to participate in our Slipstream beta program. We will help you identify, document, and systemize your core processes in Slipstream and give you an extended free trial (6 months). Please message [Pete](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petebroderick/) on Linkedin if you're interested!"

Adding dynamically generated robotic controls in VR is as easy as configuring the mesh and joint dimensions in the Unity Inspector and hitting play!\n\nWhile I don't have any of the videos of using NERVV with a VR headset and controllers to control the JunLab robots in real life (ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­), I did manage to find a recording of the inverse kinematics working in Unity's game engine.

This virtual lab also implements SPICE probing to give students actual voltage readings or plot voltage behavior over time.It's been incredibly rewarding to gradually build this application from scratch, and I've spent a lot of time ensuring that the structure is simple, modular, and accommodating for future development.\n\nAs of Fall 2020, it features 10 modules with 3-4 circuits each, as well as Brightspace support for automated grading. As part of the second phase of development, I was able to coordinate development with [Saad Jamal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saad-jmal/), who was a big help to add more labs!

With some of Drew's mind-bending Houdini magic, we were able to procedurally generate the field and animations, and package them in a compatible format for a lightweight and accessible online release."

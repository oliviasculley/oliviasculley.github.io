![An image of a laptop](/posts/free-software/software.jpg)

As you might know, I'm an avid [free software
advocate](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html), and I try to use free
software over proprietary ones as much as I reasonably can. These are some of
the free software projects that I have found, which I either use on a daily
basis or have made me say "how did I possibly live before this?". Hopefully
you'll be able to discover a project that'll make you feel the same, too!

# Syncthing

[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) is one of my favorite open-source projects
right now and one I use on a daily basis. It syncs files between all of my
devices, all through encrypted connections and with no need for my files to be
stored on the cloud (read: someone else's computer). Its easy-to-use and highly
customizable network-based UI is also extremely convenient. However, there is
still a great client for Android as well. I use it to sync files between all my
devices including my phone, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone needing to
transfer files on any sort of regular basis or replace Box/Dropbox/Google Drive,
etc.

# Quod Libet

[Quod Libet](https://quodlibet.readthedocs.io/en/quodlibet-4.6/) is currently
the music player that I use on my desktop devices. It has hundreds of plugins
that enable almost any functionality that you can think of, but the UI is still
simple and easy to use. Also, it sounds great! ðŸ˜Š

# KDEConnect

[KDEConnect](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect) provides fantastic
integration of your mobile device with a Linux computer. While it's natively a
KDE application, I used to use it with GNOME desktop through a handy [gnome
extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1319/gsconnect/). In addition
to MPRIS controls, GSConnect provides direct PulseAudio volume modification, as
well as a bunch of other handy features like remote mouse/keyboard input, remote
command execution, file transfers, 2-way notification syncing, SMS messaging and
more, all connected through an encrypted connection. While its connections are
restricted to local networks only, with a home VPN server it shouldn't be an
issue.

# MPV

[MPV](https://mpv.io/) is a great minimalist video player, with a fantastic
ecosystem of addons and plugins. I used to use
[mpv-mpris](https://github.com/hoyon/mpv-mpris) to enable MPRIS audio controls.

# i3 / sway

i3 is a minimalist tiling window manager that allows you to greatly customize
your desktop environment with keybinds. I find that it really makes it easy to
move between different windows, and makes me more productive. The configuration
relies on an intimate knowledge of command line and command line tools which may
seem more difficult, but allow you to really customize your desktop experience.
sway works exactly the same as i3, but is written to use Wayland instead of X.

# Arch Linux

I use [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) for my operating system. Among all the
distros that can be considered minimalist, Arch Linux is very popular and in my
experience, [just tends to work](/posts/free-software/works-on-my-machine.png),
albeit after a non-insignificant amount of configuration time. Its modularity
and emphasis on "working beneath the hood" are the main reasons why my computer
literacy is where it is now. As a result of bootstrapping it from scratch, I've
become extremely comfortable with essential system administration tools and
learned so much more about how computers actually work than anything I could
learn in a class. I highly recommend Arch to anyone who doesn't just want a
great operating system, but also desires to truly know their computer from the
ground up.

# Librewolf

I use [Librewolf](https://librewolf.net/), which is privacy-focused fork of
Firefox, for my web browser for several reasons. Mozilla's commitment to
open-source software and privacy has been encouraging, but I mainly use it for
the [Tree Style
Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) and
[Temporary Container
addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/),
which is all but a killer feature in my mind. This allows each tab to be
isolated from cookies and other tracking features, as well as switching between
multiple accounts super easily.

# youtube-dl

I use the incredibly comprehensive [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) for
downloading media from almost any website that hosts it, and its amount of
customizability is unprecedented. Youtube-dl also integrates very nicely with
[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) to convert files into almost any format imaginable
with just one extra argument.

# Lutris

[Lutris](https://lutris.net/) allows you to effortlessly run your games with
[Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and Valve's
[Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) with one click. It also boasts
a great UI with impressive amounts of customization (even better than winecfg in
my opinion!).

# Quassel

[Quassel](https://quassel-irc.org/) is a great IRC client that utilizes a
server/client model, as well as allowing for extensive themeing and
customization. What more could you need?

# The Lounge

Ok, so maybe you don't even want a local IRC client at all. Well, [The
Lounge](https://thelounge.chat/) has you covered with a super easy to use and
server-based IRC web client!

# Gajim / Conversations

I love XMPP, and I think it's the best chat platform, especially with OMEMO
encryption. For my XMPP client on desktop, I've been enjoying
[Gajim](https://gajim.org/), with it's recent redesign and features making it a
very nice client to chat with my friends. On mobile however, nothing can beat
[Conversations](https://conversations.im), with some of the best UI for any XMPP
application anywhere. In my opinion, OMEMO + XMPP imo is the best compromise
between simplicity, security, and ease of use for instant messaging.

# Anki

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is an incredibly solid flashcard program that
adjusts to your knowledge level to help you learn as effectively as possible. I
use it to improve my ä¸­æ–‡ vocab, and the AnkiWeb platform allows you to
effectively sync your sets to all your devices, and even your phone!

# Keepass XC

[Keepass XC](https://keepassxc.org/) securely stores all of your passwords.
Combined with the browser extension, it can also prefill form data for websites
and even fill in simple HTTP authentication, which is also super useful.

# Deluge

[Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/) is a torrent client that uses a
client/server architecture. It meets the perfect balance of efficiency and handy
features, like labels for easy sorting, that put it above other good choices
such as [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) or
[rTorrent](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent) for me personally.

# Nginx

Did you know its pronounced "engine-ex", and not "en-jinx"? I won't say how long
it took me until I realized. Anyways, [nginx](https://nginx.org) is a great
open-source hosting proxy server, and it is infinitely better than Apache.

# rsync / rsnapshot

[rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) is the swiss army knife of getting
files from point a to point b, and can be pretty easily dropped in to replace
`cp`, if you wanted. However, as the -sync suffix implies, rsync really shines
when syncing files across folders, file systems, and even completely different
machines with ssh. rsync will hash your files block by block, allowing you to
skip redundant file transfers.

I used to have a custom backup script to use rsync, but I've recently discovered
[rsnapshot](https://rsnapshot.org/), which builds off of rsync to create the
ultimate backup system. Making use of good use of hardlinks to save disk space,
rsnapshot can create efficient snapshots every month, week, day and hour. If
you're using Arch, the [Arch
Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rsnapshot) makes editing the config
file and setting up the systemd timers a breeze. I've found that rsnapshot makes
it super easy to create versioned, efficient backups.

# Jekyll / Hugo

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) are very similar
to each other, both being very easy and intuitive to use, with the biggest
hurdle typically getting them installed properly.

For me, site generators strike the perfect balance between manually creating
HTML files and using monolith or proprietary platforms like Wordpress, while
still being powerful, accessible and open-source.

While there are many other platforms that I could have used instead of Hugo that
would probably have worked just as well at hosting and sharing this content,
there's just something special when you are in full control of the product from
the raw words in the beginning to the final HTML files being served in the end.

Setting up a simple generated website/blog is a fun project that I'd recommend
to anyone who doesn't have a blog platform already or isn't satisfied with their
current workflow, and also has an added bonus of having a nice product at the
end.

# Wireguard

[Wireguard](https://wireguard.com/) is my recommended way of setting up a home
VPN connection. It takes a bit of legwork at the beginning to generate all the
appropriate keys and make sure things are working with your network, but at the
end of the day you'll end up with a secure, reliable and fast VPN connection. As
always, the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/WireGuard) is very
helpful, and if you use GDM, then NetworkManager will have full support.
However, its important to note that GDM doesn't expose all of its settings in
the default settings application (such as auto-connecting to your VPN on certain
wifi connections); instead, you'll need to install and open
[nm-connection-editor](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/nm-connection-editor/).
Just a note that the default Arch package doesn't come with a `.desktop` file
for you, either (although that's pretty easy to fix for yourself).

# Calibre

[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) is hands-down the absolute best way to
manage your ebook collection. No matter how you source them, Calibre supports a
bajillion different features from your standard metadata and tagging to some
killer features in no particular order: automatic searching to find metadata
from online sources such as Google Books or Amazon, downloading high resolution
covers from said sources, device autoconnection, and content server hosting.
Calibre is also super customizable too, allowing you to change almost every
aspect of the UI and download new icon packs from within the default settings
panel! If you want to get into reading books digitally, Calibre is absolutely
essential.

# Koreader

Another e-reader tool that I can't recommend enough,
[Koreader](https://koreader.rocks) is also an amazing open source offering,
specifically tailored for low-refresh-rate e-ink screens like on my [Kobo
Aura](https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-aura), which I love so much. It has
an incredible breadth of features, besides an almost infinitely configurable
reading experience (size, text, font, dictionary addons, network and backlight
settings) but also some extra fancy ones like Calibre server wireless connection
(no need to plug in your device anymore!), wireless OTA updates, and even a
built-in SSH server (!!!). Koreader was easy to install on my Kobo with the
[Kobo Start Menu](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=293804),
and I know that I'll be very satisfied with this e-reading experience for years
to come.

## E-reader sidenote

Seriously, if you've never tried reading on an e-ink screen, go down to your
local bookstore and try it out. It also has the added bonus of being able to
store hundreds or thousands of books in a super light and convenient package. If
you've ever taken more than a couple books with you at once before, you'll
quickly realize how much bulk and volume physical books actually have, and how
quickly they can add up. If you do get one, make sure to get one with a built-in
backlight. As an owner of the original Kindle (rip that free unlimited 3G) and
Kindle Touch, I never realized how indispensible that backlight actually was
until I got my Kobo years later. Personally, I'd recommend the Kobo since it's
much more straightforward to jailbreak and tweak the internals. However, one
note you might encounter is that by default the file system is mounted `noatime`
and `nodiratime`, which will break the "sort by last read" setting for Koreader
(it'll sort via last modified instead). To fix this, you'll want to change to
`relatime` if you can. The mounting script is in `/etc/init.d/rcS`, where you
will need to modify the above accordingly.

# FreshRSS

[FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org) is an AGPL rss reader that is self-hosted.
Personally, i've found that it's one of the most easy-to-use and feature-rich
rss readers out there. While it needs to be self-hosted, it fully supports the
greader API so that most mobile rss clients can sync with FreshRSS, keeping all
of your feeds up to date even on the go.

# Mumble

[Mumble](https://www.mumble.info) is a free, open source voice chat application
that's super lightweight and secure. I use it to chat or game with my friends,
and the desktop and mobile clients work really well. There's even a
self-hostable [web client under
development](https://github.com/Johni0702/mumble-web)!

# Searx

[Searx](https://searx.github.io/searx/) is a self-hostable metasearch engine
that aggregates results from a wide variety of search engines and services. With
Searx, your searches will be protected from tracking and profiling, only
returning you with the results that you need. Since it implements the
[OpenSearch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/OpenSearch) format,
you can even add it easily to most major browsers!

# ArchiveBox

[ArchiveBox](https://archivebox.io/) is a self-hostable website archiver that
can make copies of websites or media that you might want to save later on. Think
of it like a personal [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).

# Mealie

[Mealie](https://hay-kot.github.io/mealie/) is a self-hostable recipe planner
that doesn't just let you save recipes for future use, but also plan out your
mealplan for the week! Mealie's parser works on pretty much every recipe I've
come across, getting rid of the super long paragraphs of junk and trimming down
the recipes just to their steps.

# Jellyfin

[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) is a self-hosted, open source media server much
like Plex. I like using Jellyfin to view my media since it's fully open source
and has lots of cool features like sync play that make watching your digital
media library a joy. There are great mobile apps for Android to stream your
media library on the go, as well.

# Wakatime / Wakapi

[Wakatime](https://wakatime.com) is a productivity-tracking application that
hooks into Visual Studio Code and relays your activity to their servers. While
this service and the extension might be proprietary, there are open-source
compatible backend services like [Wakapi](https://github.com/muety/wakapi) that
you can use the Wakatime extension with instead. You can even expose Prometheus
metrics to feed your wakatime data into Grafana with [this
dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12790)!

# Home Assistant

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is a modern home automation
manager that has support for almost every device under the sun. It's super
customizable, and I've been able to completely automate my apartment's comings
and goings just from my phone's position in my pocket! If you have an interest
in home automation, Home Assistant easily takes the cake.

# And more

[Awesome-selfhosted](https://awesome-selfhosted.net/) is an amazing list of
open-source software that you can self-host for almost anything you can think
of. If there's something I haven't mentioned here and it's self-hostable, you
should check out this list! In addition, the list itself is open-source on
[Github](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted).

# Conclusion

Well, I hope that you've found something that can really enjoy from the list
above. Got any more that you think I'd like to try out? Feel free to send them
to [olivia@sculley.dev](mailto:olivia@sculley.dev) and I'll be more than happy
to take a look!
